# python

I have learnt the basics with python years ago. At the beginning of 2025, however I started to learn it with more professional and DevOps focusing manner.
After finishing a 23 hours long tutorial on udemy, my knowledge of the python concept has significantly increased.

At my workplace I also could use python for file transering for our gitlab repo and runners update, or creating a backup CI/CD pipeline all written in python.
With openAI chatgpt, I can even be better in coding, and code review especially which makes me more valuable on the marketplace.

In my github python repo, the most professional projects findable in 2025 and 2026 subfolders which I am proud the most.

With my most recent project (system-infra-tool) after the building, did upload to https://test.pypi.org/project/system-infra-tool/#description which can be downloaded from and use on any linux workstations that are using python >=3.9
