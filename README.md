# python

I learned the basics of Python several years ago. At the beginning of 2025, however, I started learning it in a more professional and DevOps-focused manner.
After finishing with a 23 hour-long tutorial on udemy, my knowledge of the python concepts increased significantly.

At my workplace, I have also been able to use Python for file transers for our gitlab repo and runners update and for creating backup CI/CD pipeline all written in python.
With openAI's ChatGPT, I can even be better in coding, and code review especially which makes me more valuable on the jobmarket.

In my github python repository, the most professional projects can be found in the 2025 and 2026 subfolders, which I am proud the most.

With my most recent project, system-infra-tool, I successfully built and uploaded the package to Test PyPI (https://test.pypi.org/project/system-infra-tool/#description) which can be downloaded and used on any linux workstations running the Python >=3.9 version.

Thanks for the reading!
